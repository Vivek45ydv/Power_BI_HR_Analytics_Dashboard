Other information in the dataset includes the employee's daily rate, monthly income, training history, work experience, job satisfaction, and performance ratings. Additionally, the dataset includes a column for attrition, which indicates whether an employee has left the company or is still working.

# Cleaning and Analyzing using Power Query:
Open Excel and connect to your employee data
Use Power Query to clean and transform the data
Create a copy template for one sheet in Power Query transformations and apply the same transformations to all sheets
Apply all necessary cleaning steps, such as removing duplicates, renaming columns, and changing data types
Create a parameter to select the desired data based on a specific condition
Encapsulate all steps into a function to be reused for future sheets and data
Load and Apply the cleaned data into Power BI

# Exploring and Manipulate Some Data Using DAX Query:
With DAX Query, we can effectively manipulate and analyze the data to provide insights for visulization and identify areas for improvement for HR.
Create Measures and columns Using DAX functions such as count, sum function for exploring some clean data for improve dashboard KPI in PowerBI.

# Power BI Dashboard Visualization:
Design the dashboard layout
Create a measure table to aggregate and display the data using Dax functions
Use Visulizations for charts and filters for filter dashboard
Now, Add Title HR Dashboard
